# Accident Severity Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple example of a machine learning model using linear regression to predict accident severity based on the age of the casualty. The model is trained on a dataset, and you can use it to make predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/accident-severity-prediction.git
   
### Usage
1. Upload your dataset:
- Run the Jupyter Notebook accident_severity_prediction.ipynb in a tool like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Upload your dataset when prompted.
2. Run the code:
Execute the code cells in the notebook to train the linear regression model and save it.
3. Make predictions:
- Modify the hypothetical_data in the code to input your own values.
- Run the prediction code cell to see the predicted accident severity.
### Files
